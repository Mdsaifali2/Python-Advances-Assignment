    "        some benefits of using regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "        Pattern Matching: Regular expressions allow you to search for specific patterns of text within a larger string. This can be useful for tasks such as validating input, extracting specific information from a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Flexibility: Regular expressions provide a rich set of syntax and special characters that allow you to define complex patterns. You can specify exact matches, search for patterns with wildcards, use quantifiers to match multiple occurrences, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Efficiency: Regular expressions are highly optimized for performance, allowing you to process large amounts of text efficiently.\n"
