    "# Q1. What is the purpose of Python&#39;s OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "        The purpose of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is to enable developers to create complex software systems that are modular, scalable, and easier to maintain and extend. OOP allows developers to organize their code into objects, which are self-contained units of code that encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        By using OOP in Python, developers can create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. OOP also makes it easier to collaborate on larger code bases, as objects can be developed independently and then integrated into a larger system.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        the main Purpose of Python's OOP are as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Abstraction: OOP allows developers to abstract away the complexity of a system by encapsulating data and behavior into objects. This makes it easier to reason about a system and reduces the complexity of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Encapsulation: Encapsulation allows developers to hide the implementation details of an object and expose only the relevant methods and data. This makes it easier to maintain and extend a system, as changes to the implementation of an object do not affect the rest of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows developers to create new objects that are based on existing objects, inheriting their attributes and methods. This makes it easier to reuse code and reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows developers to create objects that can take on multiple forms. This makes it easier to create flexible and extensible systems, as objects can be used in multiple contexts."

    "# Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "        When an attribute is accessed on an object, the interpreter first looks for that attribute in the object itself. If the attribute is not found in the object, the interpreter then looks for the attribute in the object's class. If the attribute is still not found in the class, the interpreter then looks for the attribute in the class's parent class (also known as the superclass). This process continues up the inheritance hierarchy until either the attribute is found or there are no more superclasses to search."
