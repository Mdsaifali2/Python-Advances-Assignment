    "# 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "        An abstract superclass is a class that is designed to be subclassed but not instantiated directly. It is used to define a common interface or behavior for a group of related classes, without providing a concrete implementation for that behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "        An abstract superclass can define abstract methods, which are methods that have no implementation in the superclass, but which must be implemented in any subclass. This allows the superclass to define a common interface that all subclasses must follow, while still allowing each subclass to provide its own implementation of that interface."

It can be accessed using the class name or any instance of the class. When a class is defined, the class variables are defined in the class's namespace."
